# InkyDesk

Software for an e-ink desk calendar. See [the blog post](https://moscardino.net/2025/05/inkydesk/) for background info.

## Overview

The code is split into two parts, client and server. Client code is meant to run on a Raspberry Pi attached to an InkyWHAT screen (red/black/white). The server can be run on the Raspberry Pi, too, but can also be run anywhere so long as the Pi can reach the server via HTTP.

Each folder has a README to explain that part and how to get it running.
